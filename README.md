# TikiTaka-Coastguard
Website for the fictional Club of the TikiTaka-Coastguard

Website is build from Scratch with no instructions on building.

I am overall quite happy with the side, I need to look into Buttons again but it was not to bad. 

I am also happy to possition my objects on the big screen, however I dont really know how to make them perfectly responding to different screen sizes (see "JOIN NOW" button) 

I would be happy if somebody got some Idea how to improve this
